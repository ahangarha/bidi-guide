# bidi-guide

The current web suffers from a lack of proper support for rendering text in the correct direction. When it comes to social media or messaging platforms in which we have a lot of user-generated text, we need to deal with text in different languages, some of which are in RTL (Right-to-left) direction. There are even cases in which people make a post in which they use both RTL and LTR text. On many platforms, such texts render in an unreadable fashion.

The solution or at least one solution is to add bidi (bidirectional text) support. In this repository, we discuss the issue, make technical guidelines and share success stories. We think adding bidi support makes the future of the web more beautiful and more inclusive.
